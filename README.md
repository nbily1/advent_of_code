# Advent of Code

This repo contains my solutions to puzzles from the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) competition.

All code and solutions posted are original (with the occasional function usage tip from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)).

Not all code is optimized, but it gets the job done in a reasonable amount of time running python 3.10 on a Windows 10 machine. Most solutions use only the base mython libraries with rare assistance from [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
